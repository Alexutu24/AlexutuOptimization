## 📖 About The Project

**Alexutu Optimization** is a powerful Windows utility designed to reduce input lag, boost FPS, and streamline system maintenance. Built with a modern WPF interface, it offers a safe and easy way to apply complex system tweaks.

Unlike other optimizers, this tool prioritizes system safety by integrating **System Restore Points** directly into the workflow and includes a self-updating mechanism to ensure you're always on the latest version.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Safety First
* **Smart Restore Points:** Before applying any major tweaks, the app can automatically request Windows to create a System Restore Point. Never worry about breaking your OS again.

### ⚡ Optimization & Automation
* **Script Manager:** Execute verified PowerShell optimization scripts with a single click.
* **Input Lag Reduction:** Custom tweaks targeting mouse and keyboard latency (Velocity/Overdrive plans).

### 🤖 Modern Integration
* **Discord Authentication:** Secure login using Discord OAuth2. Your subscription plan is automatically detected based on your Discord roles.
* **Auto-Update System:** The app checks for updates on startup. If a new version is found, it downloads and installs it silently in the background—no browser required.
* **Session Management:** Stay logged in for 4 hours without re-entering credentials.

2.  Download the latest installer: `Alexutu_Setup.exe`.
3.  Run the installer (Admin privileges required for optimization tweaks).
